		<li>Cook the bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until it's crispy. Once cooked, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain off excess grease.</li>
		<li>Prepare the tomatoes: Slice the tomatoes thinly and set them aside.</li>
		<li>Assemble the sandwiches: Take two slices of bread for each sandwich. Spread butter or mayonnaise on one side of each slice.</li>
		<li>Layer the ingredients: On the non-buttered side of one slice of bread, place a slice of cheese, followed by a layer of cooked bacon, then a few slices of tomato. Top with another slice of cheese and cover with the second slice of bread, buttered side facing outwards.</li>
		<li>Grill the sandwiches: Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the assembled sandwiches onto the skillet or griddle. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
		<li>Serve: Once the sandwiches are grilled to perfection, remove them from the heat. Allow them to cool for a minute or two, then slice them diagonally and serve hot.</li>
		<li>Enjoy your delicious grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon and tomato! You can pair them with your favorite side dishes or enjoy them on their own.</li>
